// Triggered by the trg_notify_appointment DB trigger (setup.sql,
// pg_net-based — see notify_webhook()) on `appointments` INSERT and
// UPDATE. Sends up to two emails per event: one to the customer (as
// before), and one to the assigned expert, if there is one and they have
// a reachable email.
//
// An expert's email resolves two ways: via their linked login account
// (experts.profile_id -> auth.users.email) if they have one, or via
// experts.notification_email as a fallback for a directory-only listing
// with no login access. If neither is set, the expert side is silently
// skipped — the customer email still goes out either way.
//
// Payment gating: an appointment row is inserted as soon as the booking
// form is submitted, `payment_status: 'pending'`, BEFORE the Razorpay
// checkout modal even opens — so nobody gets emailed at insert time.
// Nobody hears about a booking until it's actually paid for: the
// "booking received, awaiting expert confirmation" email fires the
// moment payment_status flips to 'paid' (via confirm_appointment_payment,
// called from payment-webhook or the free-coupon path), not at insert.
// Every other status transition (confirmed/completed/cancelled) is also
// gated on payment_status === 'paid' — belt-and-braces alongside the
// prevent_unpaid_appointment_confirm DB trigger, which is the actual
// enforcement boundary stopping status from reaching 'confirmed' unpaid
// in the first place.
